Hi! I'm Jess, a Frontend Engineer specialised in Web applications.
React, Typescript and NextJS are my main areas currently, but I have
also worked with many other frameworks, Content Management Systems and
libraries.

I created this small project in NextJS, a framework for React,
displaying a couple blog posts which are generated automatically from
a folder with .md files.

This project was done by following the official Next.js tutorial( [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) and
studying their documentation. Once it was done, I uploaded it to
Github and deployed it using Vercel.

Thanks for your visit!
