I created this small project in NextJS, a framework for React,
displaying a couple blog posts which are generated automatically from
a folder with .md files.

We can create as many Mardown file as we we want, and the code will automatically gerenate and render the post pages accordingly, without any extra coding needed.

Try it yourself:

- Clone this branch
- Run it with npm run dev
- Create a copy of one of the posts on /post
- Change the content
- Check out your new blog :)

I chose this project to excecute because it displays the logic we need when using headless CMSs like Stripe, Dato, etc. The difference is that instead of local MD files, we call an API to fetch the posts from the CMS itself, and we have a much nicer interface to add and edit posts (or any other form of content). But the principles on the Front End side would be the same.

Once it was done, I uploaded it to Github and deployed it using Vercel.

Thanks for your visit!
