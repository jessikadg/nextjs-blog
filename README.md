        This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

         Hi! I'm Jess, a Frontend Engineer specialised in Web applications.
          React, Typescript and NextJS are my main areas currently, but I have
          also worked with many other frameworks, Content Management Systems and
          libraries.

          I created this small project in NextJS, a framework for React,
          displaying a couple blog posts which are generated automatically from
          a folder with .md files.

          This project was done by following this{" "}
          <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn">official Next.js tutorial</a> and
          studying their documentation. Once it was done, I uploaded it to
          Github and deployed it using Vercel.

        Thanks for your visit!
